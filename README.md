# threejs-journey-r3f-and-typescript
[threejsjourney.xyz](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) is a course by [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/) on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) 

The course itself is taught in vanilla JS. This repo contains (will contain) all of the lessons implemented using [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and TypeScript.

React and TypeScript are my front end tools of choice, building this repo helped me learn how to implement the concepts and techniques Bruno taught, but in a declarative, React environment.
